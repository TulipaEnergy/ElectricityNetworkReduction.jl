# Contributing Guidelines

Great that you want to contribute to the development of the ElectricityNetworkReduction.jl! Please read these guidelines to get you started.

## GitHub Rules of Engagement

- If you want to discuss something that isn't immediately actionable, post under Discussions. Convert it to an issue once it's actionable.
- All PR's should have an associated issue (unless it's a very minor fix).
- Assign yourself to issues you want to address. Consider if you will be able to work on them in the near future (this week) — if not, leave them available for someone else.
- When finalizing a pull request, set the Status to "Ready for Review." If someone specific needs to review it, assign them as the reviewer (otherwise anyone can review).
- Issues without updates for 60 days (and PRs without updates in 30 days) will be labelled as "stale" and filtered out of view. There is a Stale project board to view and rev
